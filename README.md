# The New StickD00dz

This app is a website with several Web 3 integrations (HandCash, AssetLayer, and RelayX) for maximum fun. It requires a server running "SD-Server" for full operation. This project was a product of my research in Web 3 integrations, serving as a big sandbox.

**Features include:**
- Login via HandCash or RelayX wallets
- View NFT holdings for either wallet
- Functional RelayX marketplace (purchasing NFTs on-site)
- Viewing of NFT attributes
- Customizable profile page
- Profile picture borders are reactive to NFT's rarity
- Access-gated chat room for NFT owners only
- Users can send RelayX-based altcoin to one another.

### `npm install`

### `npm run start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
